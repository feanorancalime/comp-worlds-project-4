Computational Worlds Project 4
------------------------------

Project 4 is a Game of Life simulation in 3D, with the added wrinkle of the ability to create a chord network of nodes. 

The simulation uses a wraparound techique where the sides of the worlds in each peer are joined together. The top and bottom of the world continue to function as they normally do in the canonical Game of Life.

### Visual Controls

Right-click with the mouse and WASD allows you to move the camera around the game world. The simulation can be started or stopped using the button at the bottom of the window. Note that the menus will not be available while the Game of Life is running.

### Chord

The Chord menu allows you to create a chord network or connect to a peer. Start up a second instance of the Game of Life program to connect the two together.

### New Game

The New Game menu allows you to create a new game and set the time between generations in the simulation. This will reset the Game of Life to a new random collection of starting cells.
